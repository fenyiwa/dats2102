# DATS 2102: Data Visualization – Course Portfolio  
📍 George Washington University | Spring 2025  
👩🏾‍💻 Created by Aba Pobee

Welcome to my data visualization portfolio for DATS 2102 at GWU. This repository includes a collection of relevant assignments and my final project, all centered on using R and Quarto to transform raw data into meaningful insights and compelling visuals.

Through this course, I explored data storytelling, geographic mapping, interactive visualizations, and the ethical dimensions of visual communication. Each folder contains original `.qmd` files, rendered HTML reports, and any associated data used to complete the project.

## 📁 Contents

### 🧭 Final Project  
**[Hydroxyurea and the Gaps in Sickle Cell Treatment](./Final_Project/)**  
A personally driven analysis exploring the demographic and clinical factors behind hydroxyurea discontinuation among individuals with sickle cell disease, using harmonized participant-level data from five U.S. clinical studies.  
*Tools used:* R, dplyr, ggplot2, Quarto, health equity frameworks

### 📦 Assignments  
Each assignment folder includes a `.qmd` or `.Rmd` file, HTML output, relevant data, and a short write-up.

- **[Assignment 4: Making Maps](./Assignment_4_Making_Maps/)**  
  Thematic mapping using `sf`, `left_join()`, and various color schemes to explore unemployment rates in Maryland and alcohol preferences by state.

- **[Assignment 6: U.S. Vote Share Trends](./Assignment_06_Vote_Analysis/)**  
  Analysis of Republican vote share from 2008 to 2024, including swing plots, interactive tables, and faceted time-series graphs.

## 🛠️ Tools & Packages Used
- `tidyverse` (ggplot2, dplyr, readr, tidyr)
- `sf` and `tigris` for geospatial data
- `DT` and `reactable` for interactive tables
- `quarto` for clean, reproducible reporting

---

## 🔁 Reproducibility
All `.qmd` files are fully executable and designed for reproducibility. Code chunks are hidden in the final HTML reports for a cleaner presentation but are visible in the source files.
